# Clear Menu
A simple mobile menu that is easy in integrate into an existing project.

# Getting Started
- clone the repo or download the latest release
- include the `Scss` files or final `CSS` into your project
- include jQuery before including the `clear-menu.js` file
- call the `clearmenu()` function on the element that you want to act as the panel

## TODO
- let JS add the sub-menu parent class, based upon the appropriate setting
